## Reflections
I've never come across TypeScript before in my whole life. But here I found out what kinda useful tool it is. Due this language it helps sort all information of type we need, we can create functions and asing values to variables of any type we want, it makes easy to create classes using interfaces and generics, make class variables either private, public or protected. Due modules we can connect to our code some other useful external libraries. And ultimately we can organize our code with namespaces.
