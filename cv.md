## about me:

My name is Mikita. You can call me Miki in a short form. Currently I work as a mechanical engineer in a small belarusian city. That’s not a pleassure for me to be there. Some people adviced me to choose the IT-sphere. So I started trying to learn something about it. It made me feel that I have a chance to change my life when I was succededing at studying and enjoying this process. That’s the place where I can use english language (I enjoy learning english) and there are lot’s of opportunities and different ways to develop myself. The IT-sphere is a really huge world!
